## Commands in Bubble Tea

<https://charm.sh/blog/commands-in-bubbletea/>

> - **Use commands for all I/O.** By doing so your program will stay responsive, snappy, and maintainable. Even something as simple as reading a file from disk could cause a small lock up in your program, and commands are build to handle such cases beautifully.
> - **Only use commands for I/O.** Sometimes itâ€™s tempting to use a command simply to send a message to another part of the program, however due to the nature of the way data flows in Bubble Tea this is never actually necessary.
> - **Never use goroutines within a Bubble Tea program.** Bubble Tea works best when you use commands and messages for communication.
